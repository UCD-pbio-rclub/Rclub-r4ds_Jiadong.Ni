## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
## Exercise 1
ggplot(data = mpg)
# An empty layer with no dots

mpg
#234 rows, 11 columns

?mpg
#drv f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd (for types of wheel drive?)

ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = class))
#random dots, not useful because they are not consecutive variables and are not closely related

##Exercise 2
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
#If color is in the  bracket, it is referred to the variable in the dataset, not the property of the graph

?mpg
# categorical: trans, drv, fl, class, year 
#continuous: displ, cyl, cty, hwy

ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty))
#continuous color changes
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))
#continuous size changes
gglot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))
#Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape

ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty, color = cty))
#combination of multiple aesthetics

?geom_point
ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class), stroke = 3)
#modify the width of the border, only for circles?

ggplot(data = mpg)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
#seperate colors of the dots by value of displ

#Exercise 3
 ggplot(data = mpg)+
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+
 facet_wrap(~ cty, nrow = 2)
# A bunch of splitted graphs, not useful
#It means that there is no specific data in that cell where drv is r and cyls are 4&5
ggplot(data = mpg)+
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+
 facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg)+
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))+
 facet_grid(. ~ cyl)

#The . means that we only split the graph by one variable but we keep that in one row/column, depending on the dot's position in the backet

#Advantage: we can take every type of class individually, with a bigger dataset it is more efficient
#disadvantage: it loses an overall view of the whole dataset

#nrow and ncolumn mean the max number of rows/columns
#Because the 2 variable themselves have a specific number of rows/columns

#because it is easier to read when have more columns than more rows(?)
